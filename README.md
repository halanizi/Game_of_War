# Game of War README
### Hanna Alanizi

This was a fun and simple c++ implementation of the Game of War. It consists of these files:
1. War.cpp
2. Card.h
3. Card.c
4. Makefile

The Card.h is the header for the object "card" with important properties (such as suit and rank). Card.c has several functions that can be applied in order to get values and properties of the card. Both are useful in creating a deck of cards, as seen in the main program War.cpp.
War.cpp is the main program that controls the game. Essentially, it creates a deck, splits it in half between the user and the computer, and then the game is played! 
This game was created as a fun summer project and gave me some good insight on how c++ works. :)
Enjoy!
